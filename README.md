# Lab2
This is my work for LAB-2 which involves building ML models for Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data set.
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
Basic EDA was done to understand the nature of data and it's variables , few visualizations have been used to make things look simple. All variables deemed unnecesaary after performing correlation matrix check were dropped.
As required Logistic regression ML model was implemented followed by a model of my choice i.e. KNN.
Their accuracy performances were close with LR predicting with an accuracy of 96.5% and KNN with an accuracy of 92.98 which was enhanced to 93.85 at k=9 while resolving our issue request.
